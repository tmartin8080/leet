# AddTwoNumbers

Solution Details: https://readreplica.io/leetcode-add-two-numbers-elixir-solution/

Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

Constraints:

    nums1.length == m
    nums2.length == n
    0 <= m <= 1000
    0 <= n <= 1000
    1 <= m + n <= 2000
    -106 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 106
