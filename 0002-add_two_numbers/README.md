# AddTwoNumbers

Solution Details: https://readreplica.io/leetcode-add-two-numbers-elixir-solution/

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit.

Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

The overall run time complexity should be O(max(m,n)).

Constraints:

* The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
* 0 <= Node.val <= 9
* It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
